## 🚀 Running Locally

If you want to run this application on your local machine:

1.  **Clone Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  **Create Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # Activate (Windows):
    # venv\Scripts\activate
    # Activate (Mac/Linux):
    # source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Prepare Folder and Images:**
    * Create a folder named `images` in the project's root directory.
    * Place all image files (code and result screenshots) for your projects inside this `images` folder. Ensure the image file names match the paths defined in the `projects` list within `app.py`.
5.  **Run Streamlit Application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    The application will automatically open in your default web browser.

## ☁️ Deployment

This application is deployed using [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud). Simply connect this GitHub repository to your Streamlit Cloud account. Ensure the `requirements.txt` file is correct.

## 🔧 Customization (For Your Own Portfolio)

If you want to use this template for your own portfolio:

1.  **Fork/Clone this repository.**
2.  **Edit `app.py`:**
    * Change `[Your Name]` in `st.set_page_config` and `st.title`.
    * **Modify the `projects` list**: Remove the sample project data and add a dictionary for each of your projects. Fill in all the keys (`title`, `demo_link`, `colab_link`, `code_image_path`, `result_image_path`, `background`, `description`, `methodology_tools`, `tasks`, `benefits`) with your actual project details.
    * Adjust the introduction and footer text if needed.
3.  **Update `images/` Folder:** Delete the sample images and add your project's code and result screenshots. Ensure the image paths in `app.py` match the filenames in this folder.
4.  **Update `README.md`:** Don't forget to replace placeholders like `[Your Name]`, the Streamlit Cloud URL, your GitHub username/repo name, and your contact links.
5.  **Deploy to Streamlit Cloud!**
