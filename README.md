## 🚀 Running Locally

If you want to run this application on your local machine:

1.  **Clone Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  **Create Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # Activate (Windows):
    # venv\Scripts\activate
    # Activate (Mac/Linux):
    # source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Prepare Folder and Images:**
    * Create a folder named `images` in the project's root directory.
    * Place all image files (code and result screenshots) for your projects inside this `images` folder. Ensure the image file names match the paths defined in the `projects` list within `app.py`.
5.  **Run Streamlit Application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    The application will automatically open in your default web browser.
